# Theme Picker

A simple theme picker made using the :has() property in CSS
as well as a fallback for browsers that don't use it <br>
(i.e. Firefox)

## Choose your theme

Once the user has selected their theme (from the 5 currently available)
it will be stored in local storage so that it will remember their choice on reload.

Not this time. Just clone it and load it up if you want to see it, it's a simple HTML/vanilla js project.
